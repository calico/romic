\description{
Romic represents high-dimensional data as tables of features,
  samples and measurements, and a design list for tracking the meaning of
  individual variables. Using this format, filtering, normalization, and
  other transformations of a dataset can be carried out in a flexible
  manner. Romic takes advantage of these transformations to create
  interactive shiny apps for explorator data analysis such as an
  interactive heatmap.
