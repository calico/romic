Description: Represents high-dimensional data as tables of features, samples and measurements, and a design list for tracking the meaning of individual variables. Using this format, filtering, normalization, and other transformations of a dataset can be carried out in a flexible manner. 'romic' takes advantage of these transformations to create interactive 'shiny' apps for exploratory data analysis such as an interactive heatmap.
